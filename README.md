# Tilemap-Based-Game

A tilemap based game in development for my school computer science project.

I plan for the game to have a pok√©mon-esque styled graphics style with a Legend of Zelda-esque gameplay, with a overarching storyline, dungeons where the player must solve puzzles using items they recieve from the dungeon and prior dungeons to complete where they fight a boss.
